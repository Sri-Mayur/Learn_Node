# Node.js Learning Journey

Welcome to my Node.js learning journey! This repository documents my progress as I learn the basics of Node.js, focusing primarily on backend development.

## Current Focus

### Creating a Server
I am currently learning how to create a server using Node.js. This is an essential skill for backend development, and I am excited to dive into it.

## Future Goals

As I continue to learn, I plan to explore and master the following topics:
- Building RESTful APIs
- Working with databases (e.g., MongoDB, MySQL)
- Implementing authentication and authorization
- Using frameworks like Express.js
- Deploying Node.js applications

Stay tuned for updates as I progress on this journey!
